RabbitMQ has 5 major components:
1. `Message`: A piece of data that is to be transmitted. A message is 'tagged' with a `routing key` that is used by the `exchange` to decide which `queue` to push the `message` to.
2. `Producer`: A program that publishes `messages` to an `exchange`. It does not know which `queue` the `message` will be pushed to. It only sends the `message` to the `exchange` and lets the `exchange` decide which `queue` to push the `message` to based on the `routing key` of the `message` and of the `queues`.
3. `Exchange`: Receives `messages` from `producers` and pushes them to `queues`. An `exchange` can be of 4 types: `direct`, `topic`, `headers`, and `fanout`. `Exchange` decides which `queue` to push the `message` to based on the `routing key` of the `message` and of the `queues`. If no matching `queue` is found, the `message` is discarded.
4. `Queue`: A buffer tagged with zero or more `routing keys` that stores `messages` from the `exchange` until they are received and/or processed by a `consumer`.
5. `Consumer`: A program that receives `messages`. It subscribes to a `queue` and receives `messages` from the `queue`. It does not directly care about the `routing key` of the `message` or of the `queue`. It only receives the `message` from the `queue`. However, as the `message` is pushed to the `queue` based on the `routing key` of the `message` and of the `queues`, the `consumer` indirectly receives the `message` based on the `routing key` of the `message` and of the `queues`.
